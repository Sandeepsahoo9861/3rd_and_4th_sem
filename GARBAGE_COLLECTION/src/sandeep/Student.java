//The JVM only runs finalize() when it's about to destroy an object â€” and that only
//happens when the object becomes garbage (unreachable) and the Garbage Collector decides to collect it.
//No garbage = no finalize.
//Even if garbage exists, finalize() runs only if GC chooses to clean it.

//....

//GC (Garbage Collector) automatically deletes objects that are no longer reachable (garbage) from memory.

//finalize() is called by the GC just before it deletes the object to perform 
//cleanup tasks (like closing files or freeing resources).

//You don't call finalize() manually, it is called automatically by GC if the object is being collected
//......

//Example Flow:
//You call System.gc(), which requests the JVM to run the Garbage Collector.

//The Garbage Collector looks for unused (garbage) objects.

// If an object is garbage, GC will automatically call finalize() for that object before removing it from memory.
