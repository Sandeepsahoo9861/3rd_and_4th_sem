//.........................................
//What is System.gc()?
//System.gc() is a request to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to run garbage collection ‚Äî that is, to clean up memory by removing objects that are no longer used.
//
//But remember:
//‚û°Ô∏è It's just a request. The JVM may or may not do it immediately.
//üîç What is finalize()?
//The finalize() method is a special method that Java calls before an object is destroyed by garbage collection. You can write code inside finalize() to do cleanup (like closing a file or releasing a resource).

//‚öôÔ∏è How They Work Together
//In your code:
//System.gc();
//You are asking the JVM to do garbage collection.
//If the JVM agrees and decides to destroy an object, then it will call:

//finalize();
//just before destroying the object.
